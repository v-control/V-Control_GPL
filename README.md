V-Control is designed to be an all in one control solution for many markets such as Show Control, Control Rooms, Venues, Museums, Theaters, and Home and Bulding Automation. V-Control is a multi platform software for Windows, Linux and MAC OSX, that turns a PC into a multipurpose control solution. Because of it’s PC based architecture, it  can run on very small embedded PC’s with low power consumption (e.g. Intel Atom or VIA platform) and robust SSD drives, or redundant multi-core machines for multi-threading applications.

## V-Control Applications

    Show Control
    Theater / Museum
    Venues
    Building Automation / Facility Control
    Home Control
    General Purpose Control System

## V-Control Feature List:

    frame synchronous control of devices
    interactive
    easy to use cuelists
    build in scripting
    build in calendar for scheduling
    control devices that are attached to other V-Control nodes
    handle external events (button trigger, sensor trigger)
    Open system
    write device drivers with the build in driver editor
    V-Control itself is controllable via TCP, UDP, HTTP and RS232. This enables integration and interaction with 3rd party control systems

With its diverse programming models, V-Control fits the needs of the user for the desired application. For most applications, the easy-to-handle cuelists will work to quickly reach the target. For interactive applications, an integrated Basic compiler is available, which was expanded to include special commands for device control.

V-Control is therefore suitable for a wide range of applications, from home control to powerful show control for theater, trade shows, theme parks and shows. The PC-based architecture allows a high degree of scalability and flexibility, and attractive pricing.
Connectivity

V-Control is an open system. It can control other devices or media control units, but offers interfaces (RS232, TCP, UDP, Web) to be controlled by other applications as well. The user can add new device drivers even for high complex devices at any time.
